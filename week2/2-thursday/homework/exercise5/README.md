Implement the following without using a while or a for loop.

Pass the following array
```
[
  {
    name: "Los Angeles",
    temperature: 60.0
  },
  {
    name: "Atlanta",
    temperature: 52.0
  },
  {
    name: "Detroit",
    temperature: 48.0
  },
  {
    name: "New York",
    temperature: 80.0
  }
]
```
as an argument to a function that returns a new array containing only the names of the cities whose temperature is cooler than 70 degrees.
