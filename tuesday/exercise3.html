        <h1>This example is about making lists</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Here's what I like about lists:
                    <ul>
                        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
                        <li>That's about it</li> 
                        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool  </li>  
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li> 
                        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list item</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
