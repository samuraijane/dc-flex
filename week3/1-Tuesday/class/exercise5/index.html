        <p>Here's a couple ways you can express yourself
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
                <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i></li>
                <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
            </ul>
            <br />
    
            You did it! You should be proud of yourself
            <br />
