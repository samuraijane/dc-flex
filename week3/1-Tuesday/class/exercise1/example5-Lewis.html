    </h1>
    <body>
        <hr />
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>
                    if you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag
                </i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag
                </b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
